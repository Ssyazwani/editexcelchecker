main objective: testing out the languages I learn to help edit excelsheet for work faster

issue at work:
manual checking would have some issues despite having excel formulas, 
many people have access to licensing table and would cause typos or accidental deletion/addition
this is so that the code is able to double check the job done

Code will 1) Read the file of excel (.csv) or (.xlsx)
          2) Check through for error
          3) When done, the code is able to print out the results
          ( No errors detected or Error detected at line ___ )
